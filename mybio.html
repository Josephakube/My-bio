    <h1>Welcome to My Bio</h1>
    <hr>

    <h2>About Me</h2>
    <p>My name is Nwaolai Chukwuebuka, and I am an international student from Nigeria. I came to Canada to pursue a 3-year General Bachelor's degree in Computer Science at the University of Windsor, and I am currently in my third and final year. I am an aspiring software developer with a strong passion for solving problems using technology.</p>
    <p>Beyond academics, I am deeply curious about the future of artificial intelligence and its role in transforming industries like healthcare, finance, and education. I enjoy staying updated with the latest tech trends, contributing to open-source projects, and continuously learning new frameworks and tools.</p>
    <p>When I'm not in front of my computer, I enjoy watching Real Madrid matches, reading thrilling fiction novels, and watching both fictional and non-fictional movies. Fun fact about me: Canada is the only country I’ve been to outside of Nigeria but one day, I hope to visit Spain and watch Real Madrid play live at the Santiago Bernabéu stadium!</p>

    <h2>Work Experience</h2>
    <p>Prior to starting my studies in Canada, I interned at Digital Micro Tech Industries in Nigeria as a Computer Engineering Intern. My responsibilities included assisting with the installation and configuration of hardware and software systems, troubleshooting hardware faults, and supporting the engineering team in embedded system testing and diagnostics. This experience helped me build strong foundational skills in computer hardware and systems.</p>

    <p>In COMP 3250 (Data Analytics), my partner and I built a machine learning model that predicts the likelihood of diabetes in patients. We used Jupyter Notebook and Anaconda Navigator to code and manage our environment. Our project involved cleaning and preparing data, selecting appropriate models, training, and evaluating them using metrics like accuracy, precision, and recall achieving an outstanding 97% accuracy.</p>

    <p>In COMP 3220 (Software Engineering), I collaborated with a team of five to develop a desktop application using Java , an object-oriented programming language , and Figma to design the interface prototype. The goal of the app was to visualize power supply and distribution data from Canada's open government datasets. We aimed to make this data more accessible to educators and analysts for studying power trends and making data-driven decisions. We applied several design patterns including the Singleton, Composite, Strategy, and Factory patterns to ensure scalability and maintainability.</p>
